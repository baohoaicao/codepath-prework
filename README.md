**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **BAO CAO**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

If I can add more to the app I will add colors to the Start and Stop buttons, 
add fireworks features if the players win the game, 
and a message box ask the players if they want to replay the game when they lose.

## Video Walkthrough (GIF)

If you recorded multiple GIFs for all the implemented features, you can add them here: I recored 2 gifs, 1 win and 1 lose.
  I wish I have more time to create more buttons and add some more features to the game.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I have been learning Web Development and Apps on Udemy.com so I used the knowledge gained form those courses to do the Html and CSS files, 
I googled search the parts that I had a hard time to understand, 
and I also used MDN web docs and w3school to learn about the html elements, CSS and JavaScript.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I think the most challenging and exciting part in this project was JavaScript part, 
that part required understanding about how programming works and how to use logic to design a program.
Especially for a new programmer like me, I had to read each line of code 
so I can understand how they work and why do we have to use that code in certain parts of the program.
Another one was how to call the JavaScript functions in Html and modified the elements so that the code will work as expected, 
to understand this part I go on DevDocs.io search each keyword and their functions, I like this part the most. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

The question is that how to publish websites, apps and games online so people can access anytime. 
That is my goal and I think I’ll be able to learn more if I got accepted to the internship program. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more hours to work on this project, I will spend more time to add more features,
for example, if players win the game, I will add the fireworks to make it more interesting and if they lose, 
I’ll add a message ask them if they want to play the game again.
I also want to add more buttons and change the tone of each button, change the speed of each button,
apply different shapes for the buttons, try different background colors so the app will look better.
